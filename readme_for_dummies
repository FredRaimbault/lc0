GNU v2 liscence and whatnot?

For MacOS users:
Download the source file

Open up terminal
0. Install xcode developer tools in terminal using the following code in the terminal box:
xcode-select --install

git clone -b release/0.21 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0.git

7. Hopefully your lc0 folder is in your user directory (aka file path). 
If your lc0 folder is not in your user directory, you will 
need to find the file path of your folder and put it in place of the dot
the following command:
./build.sh

If your lc0 is in your home directory, then running ./lc0

--

8. The resulting binary is in build/release as 'lc0'. You can run lc0 by going to that and/or folder.

Troubleshooting for OS users:

1. Double check to make sure you followed the above steps.
2. Check your operating system. If your OS is later than 10.13, then your OS should be compatible running lc0.
3. Some old GPUs and/or graphics drivers may not be compatible with lc0. Check to make sure your graphics drivers
are up to doate depending on what graphics card you have.

Common and commonish commands within lc0:
go nodes 100 #runs lc0 at 100 nodes
position fen <fen position here> #accepts a board representation in FEN format. 
Check out lichess.org's analysis board and experiment with FENs, or use a wikipedia page on 'FEN format.'
